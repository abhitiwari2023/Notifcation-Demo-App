Dear Recipient,

I would like to inform you about a simple notification demo app in Java and XML. This application is designed to provide a basic understanding of how notifications work in these programming languages. It's a great tool for beginners who are learning Java and XML.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

Best regards,
Abhishek Tiwari
